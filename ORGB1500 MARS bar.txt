Take information and break it into smaller pieces
Need context and background, like some one doesn't know about the movie
Reflect on concepts in class to analyze characters
Covering all concepts
- Any 2 of the 3 main characters
- The concepts I am going to explore are
- The mars concept I am going to apply are to Kayla
- Tell me what you're going to tell me in the document
Note: 	- MARS for 2 characters
	- As long as you do 2 for 2 concepts
Label it, contrast or no contrast is fine
At least 1 example, multiple if you want
You want reflection for MARS:
	- Reflect: similar the same, other people, etc.
	- Apply to a situation or a way of looking at before or seen before, in a famous figure or your family members, etc.
	- I'd do that I wouldn't do that, etc.
If I had a choice which one would I usually choose, introvert, extrovert, etc.

Ethics:
	List we're going to be covering
	Values we're going to pick a couple of them and apply them
ALL parts of MARS, 2 of Ethics, All 4 Personality, a few of values, So you still do two characters..? 
Use words and concepts 
Use examples: This reaction of this character shows this, Sarah said this, This happened, etc.

One or two points for each is fine.
You can use a quote for a personal reflection if you want. 
Citation and style guides, site the source in text. Bibliography is on there.
Date of publication, etc.
