The female who used to be an undercover cop was being questioned for her actions that didn't correlate with who she seemed to be when they met her.
She tried to explain that she made the choice to do whatever it takes to win, and if that means being someone different to gain the lead then she will do it.
She evaluated her past results and understood that she couldn't win being the way people were saying that she should be; an image of herself/identity.
Her motivation towards the goal of winning was bigger than the need to have an identity on the show. 
She pooled in all her experience to react to an objective she wanted to achieve.
